sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail  while she is out.  further,  i was only copying her on messages that many  others received (so i don't need to hear back from her).  but, if this is a  standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in  california, i think it leaves a bad impression.  can we find a way to direct  urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external  lobby team?

dear ken,  i am writing to you today re: the proposed sale of enron's india assets (non-core)-  fyi: i am currently an associate/manager in the research group at enron. i have degrees in mech. engg & finance, and will be graduating from rice with my mba in march of 2002. i have been following developments in the dabhol matter since the summer of 2001, when i was asked to help put together a briefing/presentation for ben glisan, former treasurer, enron corp.  i recently read with great interest the proposed enron re-organization plan. i strongly believe given the opportunity, i can help achieve a successful resolution of the company's various issues in india.  in my humble opinion, our current india project negotiation team is unlikely to get the best price for enron's shareholders.  my background includes:  1) the solicitor general of india is my brother's father-in-law.  2) father currently holds the rank of secretary, govt. of india in new delhi. he is a close friend/advisor to both mr. vajpayee(p.m.)and mr. advani (home minister) mother was on the faculty of univ. of michigan,& best friend of mrs. indira gandi, p.m. of india.- she is currently professor emeritus (intl. law) univ. of delhi, un expert & member, foreign relations committee.  3) my parents both earned ph.ds from the univ. of michigan,and have lived & worked in the u.s. for several years-  4) i have substantial, successful experience in asia.- india & i am extremely familiar with the laws/regulations in india.  5) born & raised in the u.s., i am a u.s. citizen. but i am fluent in hindi and other local indian dialects.  6) my previous assignments have included a successful stint as country manager in india(new delhi) for hyundai corp. i successfully led a multi-national/cross-functional project team in addition to my executive responsibilities during this assignment.  7) over 12 years of operating management experience with united parcel service.  i have extensive experience in logistics and other transportation issues.  given the current financial situation of the company and your efforts to marshall all the company's resources efficiently, i will stand-by to hear back from you.  hope you and your family have a very happy holiday season!  regards, pravas sud research group (19th flr) 1400, smith street work: (713) 345 2419 home: (713) 283 5825 cell: (832) 647 8738

for october 19: put the obsession and dedication back into your job,                      health, and daily life. stressful matters beyond your  control have leached away                      much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable. use  this mercury retro                      period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your  health and lifestyle.                      the resources and relief you seek are available, but you  may be expected to                      kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. are you  willing -- or not? i can't                      blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to  compromise your                      vision. but if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3  weeks to cook up an                      agreement you can live with.

central parking is currently working on the gated access system of the allen center garage to improve its operation.  over the next four to six weeks, the existing system will be replaced with new, improved technology.  in the meantime, enron property services is working with central parking to develop a short term solution to improve access in and out of the garage.  if you experience a problem entering or exiting the garage with your access card, call martin katz at extension 59322.  indicate where the problem occurred (gold, green or blue garage), whether it was upon entering or exiting, and the time of day the malfunction occurred.  this will enable property services to help central parking pinpoint the problem areas that should be addressed first.  if you currently use a transponder for entering or exiting the allen center garage, please contact the parking & transportation desk at extension 37060.  arrangements will be made to immediately replace your transponder with a new access card.  the transponder system is experiencing the majority of problems and will be taken out of service in the future.

on may 16, ferc clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades  associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network  upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator  connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and  stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the  upgrades once the delivery service begins.  once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is  limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.  generally, enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection  and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of  interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be  available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for  transmission away from the generator.  kinder morgan v. consumers energy  (docket no. er01-1587-000)

fyi - i will be out of the office for the two meetings on wednesday this  week.  i will be working in chicago monday and tuesday next week.  i will be  back in the office on wednesday of next week.   todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  can you e:mail that to me?  if  not available electronically, i will see it when i am back in the office next  wednesday.     if no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process  and opportunities that may be presented there, i will do that when i am back  in the office next week.  my first move will be to sit down with jeff  sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours  that james scribner sent you.  when we look at numbers of confirmations and  compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which  activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed   to absorb increased business more easily.  i also think that jeff will be the  best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to  simply life at enron and perhaps create value externally.  all of the  advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the decaf system,  auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm  group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for  implementation.  no doubt, jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.       --

here are my first thoughts on this:  if we are to agree to exit fees, which i think we obviously have to to be  credible.  the definition of,   ...costs imposed on the portfolio that are  directly related to the load of the departing customer,    should be the value  of portfolio costs (including generation at embedded costs, qfs at cost,  contracts, etc.) compared to market.  the ld cannot be just based on the  liquidation of contract costs, or we don't get the benefit of embedded  generation value (which today would liquidate as a credit).  this may bite us  if market costs drop below embedded generation, but we are out of business  now if we don't get it.  also, if we don't get the market liquidation value  of embedded generation then the portfolio gets, all else equal, a lower cost  resulting from the departing load - not fair or equitable.          enron energy services

phil,  for the michcon storage payment that is to be paid on 3/25, please change the note and delete that the payment request is still pending.  i gave my stuff to doug on thursday night and rita was finishing up the wiring form last night.    for the $5313 payment for the bear creek storage et. al. that is shown to be paid on 3/25, we need to delay the payment until we can resolve the pricing and volume questions with the pipeline.  i recommend that it be delayed until say 3/29.  there is a chance that the payment will be lower than $5313 once we get everything resolved.  is there a problem if the payment is reduced right before it goes out the door?  ruth
team,    i have created a group calendar for us (attached below).   if you know of any additional time that you will be out of the office 1/2 day or more in july or you have anything else you would like added, please advise by  close of business today, so that i can print the calendars and distribute.    many thanks!  heather
hey i'm sorry about your summer vacation not working out.  it would have been cool to take all that time off but you wouldn't want to come back now would you?
opps, misspelled cinergy.
our current cash balance with reliant is $52,850.00.  we did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  i have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on friday april 12th.  melissa, i had to move the payment to friday because some enron   approval   people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill monday.  also, tiffanie wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective march 1st forward.  my worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  i will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the summary worksheet in this file.
thanks... tell me whenever it is convinant for you.
are ya'll in the new building?  if so, i will come over and check it out.   thanks again,  jdliii

i don't even know dave so i wouldn't judge him.  i just worry about you being  with someone that has a bad temper like that.  you know eventually that  temper might be aimed at you.  i know you can take care of yourself and i am  sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't  mean i can't worry about ya.  :)   so i didn't go anywhere last night.  i am  feeling pretty sick and burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in  until about 12 last night.  i haven't talked to him yet today and last time i  talked to him i told him i had plans tonight which have been changed.  i  would like to go out with him but i don't really feel like drinking and i am  really trying to cut back on it.  this thing with my dad has really scared me  about drinking and bieng more healthy.  i am not pretending that i am going  to stop drinking i just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on  it.  there is no need for me to get as drunk as i did last weekend.  boy is  that a great story! if i do go out with burns tonight should i call you?

talked to bill mccoy at morgan, stanley about the richard shelton affidavit.   he was aware of the efforts made last week, but not directly involved, b/c he  was out of the country.  now that he's back, he said he would check into it  further, but he's doubtful that morgan will be able to take a public position  on this.  although the commodities group is definitely in favor of it, there  might well be other constituents of the  morgan stanley/dean witter family of  companies for whom such a position could be   too confining   in other  circumstances when those other companies/groups might wish to take an  opposite position.  he said he would look again at trying to get clearance,  but he's not really hopeful.  he asked me whether rich shelton would have to  actually testify, and i repeated what our counsel told us that  cross-examination is likely but does not have to occur in calgary.  he asked  about our timetable and said he will call me back either way and will try to  expedite it.  i'll keep you posted.  regards, janice  eb3861 assistant general counsel, enron north america corp. 713-853-1794 (fax:  713-646-4842)

pls. find attached a list of password applications we've received for  transaction access to enrononline.  as defined by our business process, we're  allowed a maximum turnaround time of 3 days (including mailing the user id's)  upon receiving the pa.  please keep in mind the sense of urgency regarding  the approval process as the product control group gets slammed with requests  every day and it will be very difficult to meet our turnaround goals without  urgent feedback from you guys.  also, make sure to submit your feedback in a consolidated format and on the  spreadsheet attached below  (only one feedback from each group at a time  instead of multiple feedbacks from different people).  mark clearly what type  of access you are letting the customer have for each product on the matrix so  that we may consolidate the information efficiently.  dave forster or i will  be contacting the point people within each group (in the   to   header for this  message) periodically to ensure prompt feedback.  as the flow of new customer  slows down, the pcg will take over this process once again.  thanks for your prompt responses in advance.  you may call me with any  questions at ext. 33206 or on my cell phone (011+44 777 556 8558).  regards, rahil

can you check on the name of rag american coal sales company.  we have a note  in our financial trading agreement database that pursuant to a certificate of  amendment filed with the delaware secretary of state, rag american coal sales  company further changed its name to rag coal sales of america, inc. on  4/6/2000.  our file is missing so i cannot find the hard copy of the name  change.  thanks.     adnan patel@enron  11/10/2000 09:25 am
gcp does have the correct name on file. the company changed its name from  cyprus amax coal corporation to rag american coal sales company and then to  rag coal sales of america. i had talked to the legal when i first found out  and provided cheryl johnson in global sap, with all the name change  documents. you may contact her at x33103 in order to request  those........................adnan

hello , my name is tori kuykendall (one pass bj927934).  my husband, patrick(  one pass vf751282), and i have been one pass members for a few years now as  well as elite members on several occasions.  we also use chase continental  visa exclusively, and my husband is a president's club member.  i have made  continental my airline of choice for as long as i can remember booking my own  travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.   this morning, however, i had a very bad experience.  i booked tickets for a  vacation back on september 4th for a trip from houston to new york on  december 1.  since i booked the ticket, i became pregnant and found out from  my doctor last week that i will still be unable to travel on december 1st due  to complications with my pregnancy.  my doctor indicated to me that i may not  be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in june.  i  spoke to leroy peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he  indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on  september 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time i  book a ticket for me or my husband.  i understand that this is the same  policy that you would have given me if i had just decided that i didn't feel  like taking a vacation this weekend.  in my opinion, this is an unacceptable  policy in the event of medical complications.  as you can see with my  situation, it is unlikely that my husband and i will be able to plan a  vacation by september of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month  old child.  i repeatedly asked leroy if there was anyone else who could help  me or anyone i could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your  policy.  i indicated that i could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  he  was very rude to me, stating   you don't have to ask me 7 different times for  the same thing - i already told you no!    i had to cancel a flight for work  about a month ago on southwest airlines for the same reason, but i was hoping  that i would be able to fly again by now.  for your information, your  competitor was very helpful.  they accepted my doctor's note, gave me a  credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another  person's name if i am still unable to use it.  that ticket was also booked as  a non-refundable fare.  although i have always used continental  for my  personal travel, the treatment i have had in this difficult time has  definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  if there is anything you  can do to help, i would greatly appreciate it.

attached is the transwestern capacity release report that provides information for september 2001 invoicing.  the spreads to the california border narrowed during the month of september.  therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by pg&e (core) are below tw's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate. tw schedulers - i have left a copy of the flash invoices (processed as of late friday) for all capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts in amy's chair for your final disposition.  i have flagged all which may require some additional review/correction on your part.  i will be on a flight out monday lunchtime for customer training and will not be back in the office until thursday.  if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by pager (800-718-0830).       thanks, elizabeth
it seems as though this needs to specifically indicate, if they release the capacity only receive the rate provided for herein.  no rollover rights and rate provisions must be within min and max-   mary kay
it is not intended to be a negotiated rate. we will add the other language when a definitive agreement  is executed.
looks fine to me
is the intent that this will be a negotiated rate?  if not,  do we need to add language that the discounted rate will be between max and min rates?  all else looks fine. --  teb

the word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance  sheet.  if the coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted.   therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that  the coral transaction will close.  the assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by rob taylor, and  he thinks the agreement is fine.  kay     raimund grube 12/04/2000 07:01 pm

well, i know jack probably won't know where to pee since won't have rosco to  aim at.  i guess kaley will have to growl at jack just to stay in practice.  i should add that kendall is due at the end of next week, and if something  urgent comes up, i could have to cover for carlos.  not likely but you know  how the baby stuff goes.  i think rosco is going to be at least 70 pounds, although i don't have any  information to go on.  you mentioned that his pop is a big dog, so i guess we  should expect him to be big.  maybe one of those tall labs.  i just hope his  personality stays the same.  kay         neil mann   <nmann@erac.com> on 03/13/2001 12:17:20 pm please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

rob, in response to  your voice mail today regarding the request to proceed with  substation i offer the following. i spoke with jim alexander today who should  be in touch with you tomorrow.  the overall cost profile of the respective  construction requires us to authorize this level of expenditure to provide  the up front engineering work, drawings and to place the order for the  transformers.   jim will be responsible for providing me with any details  that you need to justify the authorization request.  i will follow up with  jim tomorrow although i will be travelling after approx. 10:30 am and want to  make sure we get this ball moving.   as you recall, our estimate of construction timing was short when we  originally requested the initial release for the power line and substation  work.  ecs submitted a separate release for the power line work but the  substation release has lost another 2 1/2 weeks of the schedule.    if you have any questions or need to contact me over the next 2 days, please  call my office at 853-3463 and have melissa  page me or leave a detailed  message.  as i mentioned to teb, contact gerald nemec at 853-3512 to pick up  and facilitate our execution of this agreement while i'm out of the office.   i will be back on thursday.  thanks mk

hey nicki-  i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.    i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again.    cooper  p.s. my sister-in-law really liked her sweater and it fit perfectly.
