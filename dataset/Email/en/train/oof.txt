hi there,  a brief farewell......     today, friday the 13th,  is my departure date to the tombstones of egypt,  please wish me luck.  i will be roughing it out for the next month on trains, planes, boats, tennis  shoes and a backpack on my back.  what started out as an easy, pleasant and  classy 4-star hotel kind of trip ended up as a low budget, high impact trip  to cover more grounds and to keep spending in check.  no rocks will be  unturned.  i am taking requests for light-weight souvenirs from france (paris, nice, the  french alps), switzerland (lake geneva), greece (athens, mykonos, crete), and  egypt (alexandria to  aswan).  this is a bribe for being away from work for a  month without a laptop.  sorry, i don't think i can access email on trains.  i will check voice messages and email through my vickyha@onebox.com account  periodically.  if all is well, i will be back in the office may 14th.   vicky

i would like to take off fri (28th) and mon (31st).  since tana will be back in the office on fri, that would allow one other person to take of wed. and thurs., and one to take of fri and mon, give each of us a nice break, and still leave two of us here on all days.  you better grab your chance now!  holly, please count one of those days as my discretionary day.
last friday, amerada hess opted to proceed first with getting the isda master agreement between ena and amerada hess corporation (  ahc  ) completed before addressing the master netting agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  the following has occurred:  a. enron corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to ahc on 10/29/01, as was certificate of incumbency attesting to authority of mary perkins to  sign the guaranty;  b.  initial draft of our comments to ahc's form schedule was sent to ahc on 10/30/01;  c. draft paragraph 13 to credit support annex received from ahc;  d. assignment and novation of transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by hess energy services company, llc (  hesco  ) to ahc executed and sent to ahc for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);  e.  first amendment to hess energy trading company, llc (  hetco  ) isda master agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to hetco by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to hess for execution of 11/5/01;  f. conference call with chuck cerria and dana dellacona to review schedule;   g.  letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by hess energy services to ahc executed and sent returned to ahc on 11/6/01;   h. received request on 11/6/01 from chuck cerria at ahc to look at form of assignment and novation of transactions document used for hesco assignment for use in assigning all of ahc's financial trades to hetco.  reviewed document and, after confirming that i did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after i received the approval of bill bradford and our credit group, i told mr. cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under hetco isda master agreement.  mr. cerria is amending the documents accordingly;  i. on 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of paragraph 13 to credit support annex to dana dellacona with caveat that ena credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the isda negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ena after credit review; also worked through it with dana and john butala.  dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;  j. received redraft of schedule to isda from dana dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.  i have told everyone at ahc that i will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  copies of all of the above are on my desk in a file marked   hess  .
hi, george:  attached for your review are our comments to your form of schedule to the isda master agreement, together with paragraph 13 to the isda credit support annex.  i am also attaching for your review, a proposed amendment to the confirmation for deal no. 514094.01.  i will be out of the office from thursday, july 5 through monday, july 9.  if you have any questions during this time, please do not hesitate to contact sara shackleton at (713) 853-5620.  we look forward to hearing your comments.  thanks!  marie   marie heard senior legal specialist enron north america corp. phone:  (713) 853-3907 fax:  (713) 646-3490 marie.heard@enron.com

per our conversations with tony walden at vng, tony has been instructed not to release any funds to enron per beth white, vp & controller of agl.  agl is the parent of vng.  i will be out of the office on wednesday, but if you need any more information from settlements, please contact margaret dhont, at 713-853-7683.    here's the blow by blow:  tuesday a.m. tony walden (vng) told kay khan (settlements coordinator for ena) that he had the payment set up in their system to pay ena $7,264,089.42, but that per beth white, vp & controller of agl no payments were to be released to enron.  around 11:30 - bryce baxter contacted beth white to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment.  left message.  tuesday p.m. around 3:00 - bryce baxter called beth white again and spoke with her secretary.  her secretary said she would send beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet.  around 4:30 - bryce baxter called beth again and left another message.  kay khan also called tony walden again and left another message, letting him know we hadn't received a call back from beth white.  david jones has also called a couple of his commercial counterparts at vng/agl today, but was not able to get a response.  i tried to talk to david tonight so i could give you specific names, but was unable to reach him.
i will be out of the office until thursday, but i hope to have a response to  many of the questions in this email on thursday.  overall, i think the work  flow is fine, but i think we need more dialog with the insurance folks about  how we respond to future leaks when we need entrix personnel on site quickly,  and about the scope of work that aig would authorize entrix to do in an  initial site assessment.  i will cover these items in my response to the  questions.  rich myers is working on a summary of expenses per work authorization order,  but be aware that some of the orders are not related to tx-nmx sites.  also,  by the way, we get the top entrix discount on hourly rates, so the rates that  aig pays is slightly higher than ours.  cutty

craig,  attached please find a revised draft of the ormet contract.  i have  incorporated the language from the credit worksheet prepared by jason  williams.  that language is included in sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the contract  and in the definitions for material adverse change, guarantor, funded debt,  current ratio, and net worth.    regarding amy baird's memo, i have made the requested changes in article 3  of the contract regarding changing   schedule   and   scheduled   to   deliver    and   delivered   and   receive   and   received  .  i did not add the language  requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the  definition of   replacement price differential  .  i included the language she  requested under (iv) as (iii) in section 3.2  i omitted the last sentence  relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we  discussed and left in the language in section 8.3 which limits the  consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the  agreement.  likewise, i did not delete the language from section 8.3  providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express  representations and warranties provided in the agreement and that all other  warranties are being waived.  i did delete the language relating to texas law  and sentence starting with   therefore, the parties agree that (i) three    because we had agreed to delete the language from section 4.1 which set forth  the method of determining a party's liquidated damages. i added a sentence at the end of section 8.5 relating to trial before the  court with waiver of right to jury trial.  i deleted the language relating to  arbitration in appendix 1.   as we discussed, i did not make the change to force majeure.  we need to  discuss this.  our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation  on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  if  the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our  obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to  cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was  available capacity on such other pipeline.    please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your  understanding, you may forward it to the folks at ormet.  i will be out of  the office on monday, but will be available by phone.
jason --  attached are the documents with the changes incorporated.  as we discussed on friday, the plant maintenance will run into november.  since we sold gas to  the plant at the maximum level through october 20th, a smaller resale volume or mw  turndown will have to be used for the first week or so in november.  also, i have  tried to adjust the formula so that you get the same answer as what your memo with the  examples indicate.  if there are a few more changes, please let me know.  i will be back in the office on tuesday.  ruth

this morning after i left home, my son joshua had a fever convulsion and passed out.   zane called 911 and believing josh wasn't breathing, gave him mouth to mouth until his breathing stabilized.     josh is okay now, but he has a severe inner ear infection.      the emt's sent zane to our pediatricians office, where they immediately examined josh and did blood work.     his white blood count is extremely elevated, which apparently is normal after the trauma of a seizure after such a fever spike.    they are home now, but my husband is quite shaken and so am i.    i'm not really up to discussing this today.  to make a long story short, i plan to catch the 2:30 p.m. bus home today.    i will be back in tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. and at full speed.   i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  alice wright enron wholesale services - legal 1400 smith st., eb3809a houston, texas 77002 tel:  713-853-5438 fax: 713-646-3491  alice.wright@enron.com

hi dorn & john, as you discovered recently, i am still 'officially' in vince  kaminski's group (my original enron corp. group). this holds true for shalesh  ganjoo as well.  i did not explicitly pick dorn or john as reviewers thinking  that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting  structure.    so, vince has agreed to 'host' the review in his group and proceed to  transfer me over to ebs officially when this quarter is overs (apprently that  was scheduled to be automatic).  in the mean time, vasant, stinson or vince  would like to get a e-mail from either dorn or john regarding my performance  from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.  i had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement  with my family already.  since i am not reviewing shalesh directly (since he  is in research under stionson), i am assuming i don't have to attend the  review meetin tommorrow. i'll be on the road starting in the morning.  if i  change this, i am told at home, that i will be in the market for another  family!  i can phone in if that is okay.   kayla, could you page me with the details?  regards,   ravi.
sorry vince i have been out of town.  please give me a call tomorrow.
guys  i'm out of the office until wednesday next week.  i'll chase you up for  feedback on your video interview with thomas next week (if i don't get any  from grant before then).  i thought i'd better clear up the fact that you're the only research people  (except me) to have spoken to thomas so far.  although vince agrees that he's  a strong candidate, anjam was strongly opposed to thomas's being brought in  for interview.  i thought last night's video interview was a reasonable way  to get an objective view from other research guys.  cheers, steve (thomas's cv attached for dale's reference: )

kay-  per my previous email, at your earliest convenience, please issue a change  order to stewart & stevenson for additional td of i hours at austin.  listed  below is my suggested wording:   subject to section 8.0 of exhibit h-1of the agreement, the seller shall  provide the purchaser additional technical direction of installation (td of  i) manhours and days of per diem (for all four units) as follows:  straight time (8 hrs/day):    640 manhours (total) @ $135.00/hour (us) overtime (excess of 8 hrs/day sundays, holidays): 600 manhours (total) @  $165.00/hour (us) per diem:      104 days (total) @ $196.00/day (us)   please feel free to   fine tune   my wording as required.  by the way, the  number of hours and days listed above are a total for all four units, not per  unit.  even though the contract currently lists td of i hours on a per unit  basis, i thought using a grand total would be less confusing for the change  order because that's how we've been tracking hours. if this change order  needs to list manhours and days of per diem on a per unit basis as well, then  go ahead and divide my totals by four to come up with a per unit basis.  if you have any questions, please give me a call.  i will be in austin  through thursday of this week, but can be reached on my cell phone at (713)  412-6873.  i will be back in the office on friday.  thanks, eric booth

kay,  here is the draft form of the contract i spoke to you about on friday.  i've also sent this to the contract administrative group.  if this draft is ok to use, i believe the only thing we have to add to this is the 'psa'.  we could consider this document as our 'scope of work' or 'statement of work'.  i'll be out of the office on monday, however you can reach me by cell, 713-516-7582  or tex pager 888-662-8505.  thanks,  brenda bonhame manager osp enron broadband services (o)713-345-1930 (p)888-662-8505 (m)713-516-7582

sue,  i am sending you this e-mail because i received your voice message well after  you left it today.  i reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book  administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the  counterparty el paso gas marketing.  all of the deals from people on my desk  are booked to the valid el paso counterparty per our conversations.  i will be out of the office tomorrow, but i will be checking my voicemail  frequently and communicating with my group.  if the same problem arises  tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because  there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing  up on your report.  thank you,  errol mclaughlin, x5-8274

patrice: i understand from jerry at crestar that you two have spoken and that we will be revising deals 599461 and 1022740 for sept 2001 to keep the firm deal, 599461, whole.  have you communicated this to kirk lenart in logistics so he can repath the deals?  i will be out of the office this afternoon, but will be back on monday.   if a payment needs to be made, we can get it out on tuesday.  we've only short paid $500.00.  going forward, should we be keeping the firm deal whole and swinging on the aos deal?  we've had some confusion in the past on how to handle these deals and i would like to be able to verify that we are accounting for them correctly.  i tried to find a copy of the contract, but have not come across one as of yet.  thanks, megan x54780

dwight,  attached is a form o&m agreement that was recently used on power  project in the us.  this form is very similar to the one you forwarded steve,  but is more detailed in the scope of services to be performed.  there are  performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output.  we would have to  add the steam output.  should be very similar.  i think this form can be  turned around to coogentrix fairly quickly once we establish what the  performance standards to be met are.  i will be out of the office on jan.2  but will be back on wednesday.  please review.  i apologize for not getting  back with you yesterday or today, but unfortunately the calpine capacity  assignment has to be signed today and it has consumed my time.  thanks
gerald-please clean up these two transaction agreements.  the basic terms are here.  please coordinate with russell diamond on the credit language so that the two of you are comfortable.  i really prefer to do everything through the transaction agreement as opposed to trying to get a new contract signed. that could cost us the deal. i will be out of the office this morning but you can contact me on my cell at 303-807-3961. thanks    - aec opal index.zip

hey,  i'm taking off for an hour, here are our positions. i have to run some  errands and will be back. i'm stopping at home too (403-245-1668). if no  problem, just email me the positions, or i'll be back before....  ryan
we are now the   enron 400   and have been officially notified that we have  earned first position in the super team start.  that means we are the very  first out the gate again this year!  awesome !  thanks to all of you for your  recruiting efforts. we've gained 125 riders from last year.  meet your team  in the northwest corner of tully stadium.    to start this adventure, just show up with your bike and all your gear at  tully stadium, i-10 & dairy ashford no later than 6:00 am on saturday, the  15th.  the feeder road going east on i-10 from dairy ashford leads you to  tully toad, dedicated as a one-way street that morning.  turn right onto  tully and enter tully stadium grounds in the first 3 gates.  no vehicles of  any kind  will be allowed into the parking lot from dairy ashford, so save  yourself some time and just follow the crowd in from the feeder road.    please park your vehicle and then go ask questions if needed so that you  don't jam up the entrance.  there are 3 drop-off points for your luggage.   each rider should have 2 luggage tags which are the same numbers as your  helmet and bike numbers.  6:15 am team picture (southeast corner of parking lot - in the stadium) 6:30 am stage for exit (northwest corner of parking lot) 7:00 am the   enron 400   out the gate!  (you have a tully stadium map in your rider manual)  the top team start will be at 7:00 am, staging at 6:30 am, and it's very  important to be there on time.  if you're not in the staging area in time for  our start, you'll be stuck back with the crowd and it could take you as long  as two hours to get out the gate.  allow enough time to park, unload luggage,  and get geared up, remembering that the freeway will be jammed up even that  early.   we want you there for the team picture, and we don't want to leave  without you, so please be there plenty early (i recommend arriving at 5:30  am).  please wear your enron jersey the first day.  this helps us to quickly  identify who should be starting with us.  i did consent to let five izuzu  riders start with us.  since they're sponsoring the whole event, i figured  you guys wouldn't mind.  so just be nice!  if you have any questions about any of this, please email me or call me at  713-646-6569.  i'll be out of the office the rest of this week in attending a  conference,  but will be checking messages and email when possible.  my home  number is 713-977-1527 and cell phone is 713-503-6313.  on friday i'm picking  up my kids who are flying in and getting their bikes ready, etc., but call if  you need anything.

bill and marcus,  per your conversation with mike pechin this afternoon, attached is our preferred eei cover sheet (which i have changed slightly since the last draft, the changes are shown in red-lined format), the form of amendment of our guaranty in your favor (referenced in the cover sheet), and the service agreement we need you to sign because of our obligation to file something with ferc authorizing our sales to you under the new eei.  marcus can explain to you the reason for the latter documents, and i believe he is agreeable, although i have not heard back from him on the language of the guaranty amendment -- we had discussed the concepts.  we want to stress that it is very important for us to conclude this asap as drafted, including having the box for credit assurances checked.  the only alternative we would consider is a voluntary closeout of the forward positions along with the attached eei agreement without the box for credit assurances checked.  i am out of the office tomorrow morning, but will be back in the afternoon, but if you can call us tomorrow in the morning, mike will know how to reach me.  mike's number is 610-765-6729.  thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you.  noel    (see attached file: service agreement form.doc)(see attached file: amendment to exelon guaranty in favor of epmi.doc)(see attached file: enron_exelon generation company, llc cover sheet 11-26-01_nht.doc)  noel trask exelon power team 300 exelon way kennett square, pa 19348 phone: 610-765-6649 fax: 610-765-7649  ********************************************************************************************** this e-mail and any of its attachments may contain exelon generation company proprietary information, which is privileged, confidential, or subject to copyright belonging to the exelon family of companies.  this e-mail is intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed.  if you are not the intended recipient of this e-mail, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution, copying, or action taken in relation to the contents of and attachments to this e-mail is strictly prohibited and may be unlawful.  if you have received this e-mail in error, please notify the sender immediately and permanently delete the original and any copy of this e-mail and any printout.  thank you. *********************************************************************************************   - service agreement form.doc   - amendment to exelon guaranty in favor of epmi.doc   - enron_exelon generation company, llc cover sheet 11-26-01_nht.doc

jim:   i am out of the office until next thursday and am not able to give you the detail you require at this time.  however be advised that v&e was engaged directly by hpl (steve schneider) back in the summer of 1999 to assist in the valuation dispute with the harris county appraisal district going forward.  at the same time, the muse stancil firm (  muse  ) out of dallas was engaged to do an appraisal.  none of the billings from either v&e or muse were ever sent to me or anyone in the corporate property tax department.  they either went to steve or tom shelton as he was also involved.  consequently, we have no records.  maybe somewhere in the legal group they exist.   when i get back to the office i will look into from our end and get back with you.   warren

please redraft the isda contract between ena and delano energy company per  the terms in the attached credit worksheet (delano2.xls).  the only change  made from the previous draft is the cp's guaranty amount and collateral  threshold.  the cp has not reviewed the first draft; therefore, chris foster,  has asked that the credit terms in the new cws incorporate credit's new  exposure appetite after the physical master energy contract was executed.   please contact chris foster, (503) 464-3822 as to his preference in  delivering this new draft.  i will be out of the office on monday and will return mid-day tuesday.   please leave a message should you have any questions.
