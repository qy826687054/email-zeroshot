based on the credit aggregation system, epmi has purchased $3,914 from the pool however we show an invoice due epmi (from sap) i/a/o $21,419 resulting in a net payable to epmi of $17,505 if the numbers are correct.   the spp policy states that if a cp experiences a debt downgrade or negative watch, a cp must give spp notice.  we need to give notice of downgrade/neg watch if we haven't done so already.
fyi.   tracy - can you figure out our exposure?   bill

cheryl,  please refer to my e-mail titled   re: cantor fitzgerald & co. executing  broker agreement   sent on 10-may-01 and remove me from these distributions.  thanks and regards, john    10/05/2001 23:46 cheryl nelson@enron cheryl nelson@enron cheryl nelson@enron 10/05/2001 23:46 10/05/2001 23:46 sent by: cheryl nelson@enron
sara  not sure how much i can add on this other than a little background, of which  you may already be aware.  enron credit has a trader in houston.  his name is seung-taek oh.  in respect  of two of enron credit's counterparties, first union and swiss re, seung-taek  trades in the name of ena, because ena has isdas with these counterparties.   i had always understood that this was a intended to be a temporary fix while  enron credit inc was concluding its own isdas with these counterparties.  no  other traders, and in particular no london-based traders, trade with these  counterparties in the name of ena.  the particular trade you mention was executed in houston by seung-taek.  i  had always understood that seung-taek had authority to trade in ena's name.   it may be worth following up with jeff kinneman on this point.  in terms of giving you the full picture, the following may be useful.  enron credit is sending a new trader out to houston.  his name is nick  stephan.  i imagine he will want to trade with first union and swiss re in  the name of ena until enron credit inc's isdas are concluded.  denis o'connell and i have been talking about drafting an isda borrowing  agreement between ena and enron credit inc.  we'll send a draft through to  you.  enron credit's originator in new york, bridget fraser, is talking to a few  counterparties that want to trade both credit derivatives and commodities.   the issue we're having to deal with is which enron entity should face  counterparties for multi-product isdas.  barrick gold is the only live one.   i've been keeping steve douglas in the loop on the ena tax side.  ed cooper  has been involved on the enron credit legal side - you may want to contact  him.  trust this is of use - feel free to give me a call.  kind regards  guenther

tracy,  i will stop by on monday to pick up these documents, i am in portland all of this week.        thanks         chris
pete,  i called glenna and she informed me that they are no longer in folsom but are in alhambra.  apparently an email was sent to you and chris in regards to this, but i am not on this distribution list.    the new ip address is 166.49.55.18.    chris will need to resend yesterday's load meter files and i will need to pull the meter files.   please chris or myself a call when you get back in the office so we can get this squared away.  thanks,  kn
i printed out what you sent me earlier, have not read it yet, and can only meet after 3:30.  that's the best i can do.  fletch
i'll be on  my cell phone (if it works at waldo lake).  driscoll will make  eol market
i spoke with mark fischer about this - tom alonso stepped out of the office  for a minute - and he said tom would probably want to talk to his contact  with fpl. so i'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. i'll  also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in  just a minute.  thanks, kate
diana stepped out of the office for a minute, but i left the e-mail printout  on her desk and i'll talk to her about it when she gets in.  kate
evelyn, i'm so sorry i haven't found these deals yet! i've left messages with  mike swerzbin and matt motley, but i don't see these trades in either of  their logs - or even in the short term trade logs. one of those guys should  be back in the office momentarily, and i'll let you know when i've talked to  them.  kate     evelyn metoyer@enron 03/06/2001 03:15 pm
kate,  geir is out of the office until monday, i will change the counterparties in  the deals for him.  if houston asks again, you can let them know that it is  taken care of.  thank you for the heads up...  bill
due to people being out of the office today we were not able to finalise a  response concerning  procedures to enable us to approve potential  counterparties to trade australian power derivatives. this would include  arrangements to cover both counterparties  with a presence in australia and  those that do not. in the case of the later group i believe we can come up  with a set of procedures to address credit, tax, regulatory and settlement  requirements.    as i mentioned this morning sydney is the first   satellite  office   to introduce enrononline. i would hope we can develop procedures that  are robust enough to be used as a template by other enron offices.    i suspect tomorrow will also be a fairly demanding day with the press coming  in for the launching of enrononline and a number of us heading down to  adelaide for project taipan. however settling this issue is major priority  for us.  we also spoke about procedures to approve  australian incorporated  counterparties who seek access to other enron products. i confirm that tana  will be forwarding details of them to me for legal clearance. i will arrange  procedures to discharge this function when i am out of the office as a 24  hour turn around is required.
this looks like and isda comparison to me.  i'm not sure who is next on the  list......
i will take care of it.  thanks for the reminder.     janette elbertson  07/19/2000 10:30 am
have a good time!     susan bailey 06/25/99 10:58 am
hi mark,   things have gone well this week.  i was able to et most of the  personnel/administrative stuff out of the way.  (thanx keegan!).     also, i  located lots of background reading on everything i ever wanted to know about  the swaps market and how we fit in.  with tana  s help, i also watched the    deal tape   which i found both amusing and informative.   i will be out of the office for most of this afternoon.   my recruiter is  available this afternoon to take me around to secure a permanent apartment  closer to work -- in the montrose or river oaks area.   i  quickly decided  that commuting from the burbs is not for me.  (you can take me out of  manhattan but can't take the manhattan out of me).
cindy - i won't be able to make the 8/17 meeting.  i will be at the 8/25  meeting.        enron capital & trade resources corp.
sorry paige - i was in south america last week - will respond today.
tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the  office for the next week or so.   we are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or  operations.  you might want to check with kate cole's office to see what she  knows.     --
good morning!  samantha had an errand to run before work this morning, and will be in at  9:30am.  if you need assistance, feel free to call me at 5-3317.   regards, keegan farrell
yes, i'm planning to be on the call.     chris long@enron  02/15/2001 10:01 am

i need to meet with my contractor who called this morning.  he is available this afternoon (he has found some crews who are available to do insulation and sheetrock).  we are going to try and arrange for the crews to come in the next day or so to begin work.
keegan, as per my voice amil, jarvis' pager number is 713-768-0402.  you can leave a voicemail message.  the pager will probably be off from 9:30 to 11 (the viewing) and 11 to 1 (the funeral).  you can also leave voicemail for me on my work line and i will check it at about 1 or 1:30 p.m. and again between 4 and 5 p.m.  thanx again for everything.
good morning!  cheryl will be coming in to the office at some point after noon today.  she has cancelled her vacation day today to address some work issues that need resolution.  she is out and unavailable this morning, but will be able to return voicemails/emails when she arrives.  feel free to contact me should you need immediate assistance.  thanks,  keegan farrell eb3875 713-345-3317

this deal is still alive.  it is just being delayed some.
can one of you please secure this price for mtm purposes.  if there are any questions, let me know. bt
we will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... lc's, cash are difficult. basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations.   thanks, bt
i will have kim get back to you today.   c
i believe this is the same order that i requested thru larry. make sure we don't double the order.   thanks,   mark
i would like to attend the 10/31 session.  will the training be in the morning?    thanks, kim.

thanks stacy.  sally did mention you'd be on vacation monday.    original appointment
needless to say, i chose this distribution list carefully, this information is extremely confidential.
fyi - if you have any problems with these #s, please call your rac representative.  thanks
have you turned in my expense report?  do you need my amex bill?  stacey
thanks.  stacey
this is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the dpr.  ric= k buy, our chief risk officer, asked that we get back to normal as soon as = possible.  i am currently working on termination statuses and when deals wi= ll be killed etc.  i am also working on a way to get the pcs cleaned up.  c= ontinue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more c= onfusion than it is worth.  thanks, stacey
good luck
chris,  i attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  from a real-time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  i believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  kourtney nelson is out of the office today but will return on monday.  i feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  feel free to see me with questions.  thanks, bill
j-flizexxx,  it was good to see you while i was in town.  i still can't believe you stood me up on saturday though...  youre lucky i had a good evening without you.  i had an insane trip home.  i got stuck in memphis overnight because of bad weather in boston.  it sucked, i got home 16 hours later than i was supposed to, and i had to pay for my own hotel room since it wasn't the airlines fault.  now im back to work though, so i am having fun there.  i have to travel to nearly the northern most point of the state this weekend for a meeting.  this week is just not fun.  well write back when you get a chance.  tell them not to work you too hard.  alan
because many of you will be out on friday morning, please remember to forward all bullet items to kim via email.  adr audrey d. robertson transwestern pipeline company  email address:  audrey.robertson@enron.com (713) 853-5849 (713) 646-2551 fax
