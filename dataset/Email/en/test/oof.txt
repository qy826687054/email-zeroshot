jeff,  hi there......sounds like penny has been equally emphatic on both sides about meeting...  so sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely psychotic week for me. i have been in london and stockholm this week - i don't think i slept more than 3 hours a night all week. i am on my way tomorrow to india (bombay and bangalore)...london on thursday...and back to new york on thursday night or friday morning. friday and saturday (april 13 & 14) are fairly free for me - would friday night work for you?  it will be difficult for me to reach you from india- given schedule and time difference, but i will be accessing email. i can be reached on a mobile number in europe on today and on thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. as of friday - in new york, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. by the way, how is the peninsula post-renovations? i liked it before the renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.  elizabeth

i'm taking monday, october 22nd as a vacation day.
i received revised financial information from our accountants late yesterday, which indicates that from enron's perspective it will most likely be a ec (not a uk) filing, unless the ec referenced the matter back to any member states.  linklaters and i are continuing to analyze this data, and i do not want to provide any notice of this to dynegy until next week after we confirm the information.   i am out of the office today and will send you the oft notice next week.   robert

jeff,  i spoke with mark palmer concerning the interview with businessweek magazine,  january 2nd.  he has asked me to participate in the article to discuss enron  media services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a  quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  let  me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to  date.   i will be out on vacation december 20th returning january 2nd.  congratulations on your appointment to ceo.   edward ondarza

sorry, but i've been out of town since you sent this.  there have been a  couple of errors pointed out to me since the publishing, most of which have  apparently been somewhat obvious (i.e. not difficult to figure out).  i'll  look into this one and get back to you.  fletcher sturm  p.s.  thanks for your support!
while you guys were all busy worrying over the california energy crisis, i  slipped down to mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even  further to the south are faring. do they still have lights? is the ac shot?  can they even make a blended margarita?  seriously, though, i will be out of the office on friday, dec. 22, and again  from wednesday, dec. 27 to monday, jan. 2. i realize this is late notice; i  did let richter know awhile ago, but i probably should have spread the word a  little further. i am truly sorry.  at any rate (below the price cap of course), while i am gone i would be so  appreciative if one of you could run the dow jones report in the morning and  the eol report in the evening. dow jones will only need to be taken care of  from wed. through fri. of next week. i will call on those days, and i can  easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know  it. if i call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. i'll call  back later.  the eol report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right  now. i will talk with nicolay kraltchev, the houston it guy in charge of  fixing it, on friday, dec. 22. it should be up and running again by friday  afternoon. again, i'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain  how to use it.  i'll be in the office on monday, dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't  exploded in my absence, but then i'll be off to the land where tequila is  better for you than water. sounds terrible. please don't hesitate to call if  you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course.  kate 503.819.2181

i'm in london today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in houston on thursday.  since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.  but if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.

jay, the spreadsheet has a summary of the exit and operational entitlements that tetco has provided enron that yankee has granted. assuming that you do not wish to modify the two smaller release offers, i have provided you exactly what needs to be done to modify the larger release offer.  it is important that the releases grant us the minimal exit entitlements by production zone to m1 per our previous conversations. i will be out of the office on monday. however, judy townsend and ruth concannon are familiar with this deal structure. judy is most familiar with the current issues. i will be visiting with ruth early on monday.  judy gets to the office earlier than ruth. she will be able to answer any questions. however, she trades until 11:00  am cst so she will not be able to spend as much time with you in the morning.   i will give you a call from the road around 9:00 am.  we will get this done together...thanks!!!

bill - i'm in copenhagen awaiting a plane and am in the sas lounge. took a shower and changed for the next flight. sweating like a bastard.  saw the timbers won last night.  great.  should make the playoffs playing that good soccer.  i have no phone (at&t did not deliver).  and no computer. if you need to mail me - send it
i wanted to send a quick e-mail to let you all know that i need to leave the office early today.  my grandmother is in a nursing home and not doing well.   she isn't expected to live much longer.  i will keep debra posted on when i  will be back in the office.  if you need any assistance during my  absence please see anna mehrer, if anna is not available please see debra or kathy s.  thank you,  jill
arrangements have been made for a fun day out of the office on friday, august 10, for the west power administrative staff as an appreciation for their hard work.  kathy axford, jill chatterton, kathy sheppard, anna mehrer, erin hall, and emily butler, and i will be out of the office starting at 11 a.m. for the rest of the day.  sarah clark and sandy ragnetti will be covering the administrative duties (answering phones, ups preparation, copying, etc.) for the department.  please see us before 11 a.m. on friday if you will need administrative support with your projects, and contact sarah or sandy on friday afternoon if you need administrative support.  mollie has agreed to be available for extraordinary requests if they come up during our absence.  thanks for your patience during our absence.  contact me if you have any questions.  fyi--on friday the admin group will be lunching at newport bay restaurant and then taking a two-hour willamette jetboat ride in the afternoon.  the weather will be perfect for it!
group,  we are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques. we are having great success with eol so far. for further clarification.      1. all deals under st-whourly--except a lending/parking deal or cut. for example if we are lending with st-sw and we buy for them in np-15. the buy in np-15 is under st-whourly, the epmicalpool buy/resale from np-15 to fc345 is under st-whourly, the inter-desk sale is made under st-whourly (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to epe is under st-sw. the export in caps is also under st-sw.   2. one deal for an on-peak or off-peak purchase or sale.--for example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to epe   3. one deal for an inter-desk sale or purchase--done by the night shift at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. we are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see st-wbom sp-15 section of aug trading sheet on 08/29/01 for an example)   4. inc sheets must be maintained, deals entered and routed each hour--only way to stay ahead   5. we are generating significantly more revenue and profit trading with eol (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with eol in 8 days.   6. meeting on tuesday 09/04 at 4pm   finally, i will be out of the office for friday and will be in seattle through sunday. you should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449. if you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to ryan slinger, (503) 789-1306.  thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail,  bill
as i will be out of the office all day tomorrow, please contact amy if you have any questions. mike has been instructed to call the receptionist for an escort to the floor.  thanks, grace
paul,    several thoughts to help the refinement process.   1.  it would be useful to understand the basis of your numbers.  a key variable in this analysis is the volume of lpg generated, which is dependent on the volume and composition of the lng. 2.  re #4 below, at this point i think that the $1.83 mm per year difference in cost justifies building a larger tank.  not only on a strictly roi basis, but also based on simplifying logistics of not having to deal with as many ships.  given the uncertainty of this deal, we are looking at one propane and one butane tank, 50000 m3 and 30000 m3, both fully refrigerated.  the ships must be able to accept fully refrigerated products.  if not, we will have to heat it up before putting on the ship. 3.  re #11 below, i agree that if we extract c3+ (and not c2+) then we should fractionate to a spec propane and spec butane.  we have not spent any time considering fractionating the butane to iso and normal.  i think that this is a refinement that will be very dependent on the volume of the butane stream.  many users that appreciate the difference between iso and normal have their own fractionation equipment. 4.  the bigger issue is whether lpg btus can justify the $40 mm lpg extraction equipment.  is anyone working on this aspect of the deal? 5.  finally, tess dyar has found some information on lpg usage in the bahamas.  we will probably have to sell into this market at a lower the price.  freeport will be easy, nassau will require some shipping.     dave  information on lpgs in bahamas: 1. propane is the most used (only minimal/tiny quantities of butane--not worth mentioning)  2. propane usage (annual basis):  freeport: 1.5 mm gallons  nassau: 9.0 mm gallons  total: 10.5 mm gallons  at avg price of between $1.60-1.70/gallon (without duties), this is an approximately $18mm industry.
david,  attached is the format of the analysis that we are working to complete with suzanne clapp. the numbers in this spreadsheet need additional refinement but i believe that you can get an idea of where we are heading. if the attached analysis were accurate, here is what the analysis would be saying:  1. enron would receive a benefit of 6.5 cents per gallon of propane by fractionating in the bahamas  2. enron would receive a benefit of 4.5 cents per gallon of butane by fractionating in the bahamas  3. incremental sales revenue of $11.4 mm per year would be realized by fractionating in the bahamas  4. freight for moving the y grade c3+ product to the gulf would be:  $6.65 mm per year using a 32,000 mt vessel or  $8.48 mm per year using a 20,000 mt vessel    does the $1.83 mm per year difference in cost justify building a larger tank? i do not know the answer to that but for illustrative purposes let's assume that the answer is yes.  5. freight for moving the c3 product from the bahamas would be:  $4.67 mm per year using a 20,000 mt vessel or  $7.53 mm per year using a 10,000 mt vessel   6. freight for moving the c4 product from the bahamas would be:  $4.88 mm per year using a 10,000 mt vessel or  $7.83 mm per year using a   5,000 mt vessel  7. freight for moving c3 and c4 product from the bahamas on the same ship but in seperate compartments would be:  $7.69 mm per year using a 20,000 mt vessel or  $12.42 mm per year using a 10,000 mt vessel  8. therefore, freight for the y grade case would be $6.65 mm per year and for the bahamas fractionation case it would be $7.69 mm per year  9. plant cost is assumed to be $12 mm higher for the bahamas fractionation case versus the large y grade tank case and operating expense is assumed to be $2 mm per year higher (we need your input on the incr. plant cost and oper.exp. figures)  10. annual incr. cash flow is therefore $11.4 - 2 - (7.69 - 6.65) = $8.4 mm per year  11. it should be easy to justify a $12 mm investment if it will return $8.4 mm per year. remember, these are extremely extremely preliminary numbers.  eric groves will let you know as soon as he has final freight numbers from suzanne.  to complete the analysis, cost estimates will be needed for the construction and operation of the liquid extraction/fractionation/storage facilities for the eight freight scenarios described on the attached spreadsheet. storage tank size will be different for each case. how does a tank size to cargo size ratio of 1.5 sound to you? remember our customers will have logistics issues of their own that will impact our required tank capacities. for the cases where the propane and butane will be shipped as seperate products on the same vessel, assume 60% of the cargo will be c3 and 40% c4 (for bahamas storage tank design purposes). also, we may have to store n-butane seperately from iso-butane.  i will be out of the office but returning wednesday, august 15. please consult with eric groves if you have questions. i will also be checking my voice mail.  regards,  paul
